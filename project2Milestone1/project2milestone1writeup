Project 2 Milestone 1

For Project 2, I’m interested in using a format similar to the coffee shop recommendation app that we went over in class.
However, I would like to do my version with restaurants in Golden. I live in Golden and I’d like to get to know my area 
better since I hardly spend any time there.  I’d like to use a colorful and cartoony style for the app design without 
making the design to chaotic. I think a bright blue background with black and white text and icons would be a good design 
choice for the design. I’ll most likely start out by using the tutorial from class so that I can definitely have a working 
app and then I’ll make it more complex and original from there. My focus will be on making this app fully functional and 
practical as well as aesthetically pleasing.
