For Project 2, I'm interested in using a format similar to the coffee shop recommendation app. However, I would like to do 
my version with restaurants in Golden. I live in Golden and I'd like to get to know my area better since I hardly spend any 
time there. I'd like to use a colorful and cartoony style for the app design. I'll most likely start out by using the tutorial
from class so that I can definitely have a working app and then I'll make it more complex from there.
